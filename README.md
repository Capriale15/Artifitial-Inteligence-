AI Examples & Teaching Materials

This repository stores self-contained examples and teaching resources for different topics in Artificial Intelligence. It is designed for students to read, run, and modify code while learning core concepts.

What’s inside

Feature engineering & selection (polynomials, interactions, binning, ANOVA, MI, RF/L1).

Model training & evaluation (classification/regression, pipelines, metrics).

Data preprocessing (missing values, scaling, encoding, datetime features).

Probabilistic reasoning (Bayesian networks basics, inference, learning).

Optimization (e.g., Simulated Annealing, Particle Swarm—intro examples).

Computer vision basics (image preprocessing, augmentations).

Text basics (BoW vs. TF-IDF, simple pipelines).

Each example aims to be minimal, reproducible, and well-commented.

Quick start

Clone or download the repo.

(Optional) Create a virtual environment.

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open the notebooks in notebooks/ (locally or in Google Colab) and run cells in order.

Repository structure
notebooks/   # Step-by-step, student-facing notebooks
src/         # Reusable functions (imported by notebooks)
data/        # Small sample datasets for quick runs
reports/     # Generated CSVs/plots from examples

Datasets

Only small samples are included to keep the repo lightweight.

For larger datasets, see instructions in data/README.md (not tracked in Git).

Contributing

Pull requests and issues are welcome. Please keep examples:

Clear and beginner-friendly,

Lightweight (few dependencies),
